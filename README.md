## About
Hi, I'm María Fernanda! I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Physics. With a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights and drive decision-making. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I have developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. My experience spans various data analysis techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe are valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I list my data science projects, highlighting the tech stack and problem-solving approach.

### Glacier Retreat Analysis (Sentinel-2)
An automated geospatial pipeline designed to quantify ice surface loss in the Perito Moreno Glacier. By processing Sentinel-2 multispectral bands with Python and Rasterio, the system calculates NDSI indices to visualize and measure retreat trends between 2020 and 2025. 👉 [View the pipeline & results](https://github.com/FernandaVil/Glaciar-Analysis-Sentinel2)

### Volcanic Ash Dispersion (Stochastic Model)
I developed a custom physics engine to model turbulent ash dispersion using Langevin Stochastic Equations. The project features a dual-mode analysis: probabilistic risk mapping and a historical reconstruction of the 2015 Calbuco eruption, successfully validated against NASA satellite imagery. 👉 [Read the full case study & see the simulation](https://github.com/FernandaVil/volcanic-ash-simulation)
