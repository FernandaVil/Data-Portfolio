## About
Hi, I'm María Fernanda! I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Physics. With a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights and drive decision-making. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I have developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. My experience spans various data analysis techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe are valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I list my data science projects, highlighting the tech stack and problem-solving approach.

### Glacier Retreat Analysis (Sentinel-2)
**Code:** [Glaciar-Analysis-Sentinel2](https://github.com/FernandaVil/Glaciar-Analysis-Sentinel2)

**Goal:** To quantify ice surface loss in the Perito Moreno Glacier using satellite imagery.

**Description:** An automated pipeline that processes Sentinel-2 (ESA) multispectral bands. It includes bilinear upsampling to standardize resolutions (10m/20m) and calculates the NDSI index to monitor glacier front variations.

**Skills:** Remote Sensing, Geospatial Analysis, Raster Processing, Data Pipeline.

**Technology:** Python, Rasterio, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, NumPy.

**Results:** Accurate identification of ice retreat trends by comparing austral summer data (2020 vs 2025).

### Volcanic Ash Dispersion (Stochastic Model)

**Code:** [Volcanic-Ash-Simulation](https://github.com/FernandaVil/volcanic-ash-simulation) 

**Goal:** To model atmospheric transport of volcanic ash for risk assessment using physics-based simulations.

**Description:** A custom physics engine solving Langevin Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model turbulent dispersion. It features a dual-mode analysis: probabilistic risk mapping via Monte Carlo simulations and a deterministic historical reconstruction of the 2015 Calbuco Eruption.

**Skills:** Mathematical Modeling, Stochastic Processes, Computational Physics, Geospatial Visualization.

**Technology:** Python, NumPy (Vectorized), Folium, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results**: Validated against NASA satellite imagery, successfully reproducing the NE trajectory and the ~1.5h arrival time to Bariloche.
