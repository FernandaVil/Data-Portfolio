## About
Hi, I'm María Fernanda!

I am pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Physics at UBA.

I see myself as an explorer using data to understand the world around us. With a strong foundation in Physics (3 years completed), I am currently focusing my energy on Data Science because I discovered a passion for solving tangible, real-world challenges—whether that’s tracking a glacier, simulating a volcano, or optimizing drone routes.

I am currently in "exploration mode," applying my skills to Geophysics and Complex Natural Systems. While I have a special interest in environmental data and satellite imagery, I am open to tackling any data challenge that requires rigorous modeling and analytical thinking.

Beyond the code: I am a lifelong learner. I enjoy scientific illustration with watercolor, playing strategy board games, and learning new languages. I bring that same mix of visual creativity and strategic thinking to every project I tackle.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I list my data science projects, highlighting the tech stack and problem-solving approach.

### Glacier Retreat Analysis (Sentinel-2)
An automated geospatial pipeline designed to quantify ice surface loss in the Perito Moreno Glacier. By processing Sentinel-2 multispectral bands with Python and Rasterio, the system calculates NDSI indices to visualize and measure retreat trends between 2020 and 2025. 👉 [View the pipeline & results](https://github.com/FernandaVil/Glaciar-Analysis-Sentinel2)

### Volcanic Ash Dispersion (Stochastic Model)
I developed a custom physics engine to model turbulent ash dispersion using Langevin Stochastic Equations. The project features a dual-mode analysis: probabilistic risk mapping and a historical reconstruction of the 2015 Calbuco eruption, successfully validated against NASA satellite imagery. 👉 [Read the full case study & see the simulation](https://github.com/FernandaVil/volcanic-ash-simulation)
