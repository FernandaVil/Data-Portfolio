# Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm MarÃ­a Fernanda! I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Physics. With a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights and drive decision-making. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I have developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. My experience spans various data analysis techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe are valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
